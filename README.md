### Generating protobufs
If the gRPC proto definitions need to be updated, the corresponding source code can be regenerated using the following command from the project root:

```bash
python3 -m grpc_tools.protoc --proto_path=./submodules/durabletask-protobuf/protos  --python_out=./durabletask/protos --pyi_out=./durabletask/protos --grpc_python_out=./durabletask/protos orchestrator_service.proto
```

### Running E2E tests
The E2E (end-to-end) tests require a sidecar process to be running. You can run a sidecar process using the following `docker` command (assumes you have Docker installed on your local system.)

```sh
docker run --name durabletask-sidecar -p 4001:4001 --env 'DURABLETASK_SIDECAR_LOGLEVEL=Debug' --rm cgillum/durabletask-sidecar:latest start --backend Emulator
```
